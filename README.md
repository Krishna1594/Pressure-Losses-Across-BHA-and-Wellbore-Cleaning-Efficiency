### ABOUT
A comprehensive spreadsheet to calculate the pressure losses, transport ratio (hole cleaning performance) and graphically show sensitivity analysis by considering multiple factors.

In order to accurately design and operate oil production facilities in an optimized means, it is necessary to predict the behavior of the two-phase flow of hydrocarbon in pipes with different angles. It would be desired to apply a more unified model to every conceivable condition such as inclination angles, pipe diameters, flow rates and pressures practically. Some of such models are available in technical literature. Practically all oil well production design involves evaluation of flow lines under two-phase flow conditions. However, the uncertainties in flow regime determination greatly affect the pressure drop predictions. A technique is thus required for accurate calculation of pressure losses.

### REPORT
A technical report as per IEEE standards was submitted to university as part of curriculum of my masters degree. Please refer to the pdf file. The excel sheet is made available for further development and educational purposes.
